 Implicit and Explicit data type conversions:
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Type conversion is the process of converting a data type into another data type.
Implicit type conversion is performed by Python interpreter only.
Explicit type conversion is performed by the user by explicitly using type conversion functions in the program code.
Explicit type conversion is also known as type casting.
Python, when performing implicit type casting, avoids the loss of data.
